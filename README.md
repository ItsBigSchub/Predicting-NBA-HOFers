# Predicting-NBA-HOFers
This project is designed to predict if an NBA player will end up being a Hall of Famer.
Data is collected from Basketball Reference (https://www.basketball-reference.com/).
For the most up to date data and analysis, the web scraping and data cleaning notebooks should be combined.
