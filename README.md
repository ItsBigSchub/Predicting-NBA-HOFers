# Predicting-NBA-HOFers
This project is designed to predict if an NBA player will end up being a Hall of Famer.
Data is collected from Basketball Reference (https://www.basketball-reference.com/).
For the most up to date data and analysis, the web scraping and data cleaning notebooks should be combined.
An accompanying story for this project is available at [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@ryanschubert20/predicting-nba-hall-of-famers-bfdc6793e080).
